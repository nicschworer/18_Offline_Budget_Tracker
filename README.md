## Description 
This budget tracker can be used to track your monetary credits and debits, even when you're offline. It is a PWA and uses IndexedDB (or other versions of IndexedDB if not on chrome) to store offline inputs until you are back online, at which time it makes the appropriate requests to your database and updates your records.

Please see the deployed version here:
